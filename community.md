## Meetings

In 2023 we are planning regular online Community of Practice meetings to share knowledge and experience on three topics:

- Registration tools and governance
- Bias tools and techniques
- AI use cases and dilemmas

If you have any questions or if you want to join the meetings, please contact DF Lab [Lodewijk Noordzij (lodewijk.noordzij@eurocities.eu)](mailto:lodewijk.noordzij@eurocities.eu).
