## 1. Overview

### What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of rules and instructions executed by a computer. Algorithms help, for example, to analyse problems, but also to make decisions. This allows a government to combine and analyse large amounts of data.

### What is an algorithm register?

Algorithm registers offer a standardized, searchable and archivable way to document the decisions and assumptions  that were made in the process of developing, implementing, managing, and ultimately dismantling algorithmic applications in public organizations.

For citizens, an algorithm register can be a medium to facilitate participation and it allows them to influence how citiesâ€™ use of algorithms impacts their lives. For local governments, it can be a tool to manage AI governance in the development and operation process according to existing public services principles of responsibility, transparency, and security.

### What is the Algorithmic Transparency Standard?

At the basis for any (interoperable) algorithm register is a data schema that determines the scope of information on algorithms and describes the dataset to support common understanding.

### What algorithms need to go into an algorithm register?

Exactly which uses of algorithmic applications need to be documented was outside the scope of this project and is, for now, left to be decided by the individual cities implementing an algorithm register.

To join the discussion on this in 2023, please read the [community section](/community).

## 2. Using this guidance

To understand if the Algorithmic Transparency Standard is usable and useful in a local context, Digital Forum LAB members piloted it in their city administration. By gathering information and populating the fields of the Standard, feedback is generated that will be used to adjust the data schema in the future.

This guidance was developed for this purpose.

## 3. Getting started

### Step 1: List algorithms

Identify and select at least three algorithms in use in the city.

Use the [.csv template](https://standaard.algoritmeregister.org/registration-v0.3.template.csv) or the [Excel template](https://standaard.algoritmeregister.org/registration-v0.3.template.xlsx) as your main algorithm register file. Execute a "quick scan" of the selected algorithms by populating the 'BASIC INFO' and 'METADATA' fields, one row per algorithm. Check out the [Standard documentation](/standard) for more information.

### Step 2: Prioritize algorithms

Based on the "quick scan" information, prioritise the algorithms to populate the Standard for.

You can prioritize the algorithms based on your organizations' strategic criteria, for example: expected impact on citizens, expected risk, expected low explainability of the algorithm, or just availability of interviewees.

### Step 3: Gather information

Start gathering the information needed to populate the Standard for the first algorithm.

Information to populate the Standard can be found, for example, by:

- Organising interviews, conversations and discussions with colleagues from different departments
- Executing 'desk research'
- Consulting technical documentation
- Consulting functional documentation
- Making inquiries with vendors

To prepare for the interview, print and read the [Standard documentation](/standard).

During the interview try to go through the attributes/questions one by one, writing down the answers.

### Step 4: Create registration

Capture the information by populating the corresponding fields in a separate version of the [.csv template](https://standaard.algoritmeregister.org/registration-v0.3.template.csv) or the [Excel template](https://standaard.algoritmeregister.org/registration-v0.3.template.xlsx). This enables you to share this file with the algorithm contact person to verify everything is OK.

### Step 5: Add to the "Algorithm Register"

If all is OK, copy the row from the separat file to the corresponding entry in the main algorithm register file.

### Step 6: Publish (optional)

Create a publication copy of the main algorithm register file.

Be sure to check the publication copy for private information and sensitive information, and adjust it accordingly.

Request for permission to publish the publication copy.

Publish the publication copy, for example to your organizations' website or data platform.

### Step 7: Repeat!

Now you created your first algorithm registration, continu with the second.

Don't forget to plan an revision date for the first registration, to check if the information needs to change over time.

### Feedback (optional, but much appreciated)

If there are any questions or unclarities about the Standard, [please let us know](/community).

Feedback can be collected from both the DF LAB participants gathering information, as well as the people that one needs to liaise with for information. Examples of questions that generate valuable feedback are:

- Is it clear what information is requested?
- Is the requested information relevant?
- Is the required information (easily) available?
- Is the requested information relevant for a baseline data schema?
- Are the fields names convenient?
- Are the field descriptions sufficient?
- Are fields for certain information missing?
- Is it clear in what format the field should be populated (eg. dd/mm/yy for dates, comma or points as a delimiter, etc.)?
- What would you do to improve this schema?
