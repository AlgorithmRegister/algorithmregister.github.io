## Towards a common Algorithmic Transparency Standard

Algorithm registers offer a standardized, searchable and archivable way to document the decisions and assumptions  that were made in the process of developing, implementing, managing, and ultimately dismantling algorithmic applications in public organizations.

For citizens, an algorithm register can be a medium to facilitate participation and it allows them to influence how citiesâ€™ use of algorithms impacts their lives. For local governments, it can be a tool to manage AI governance in the development and operation process according to existing public services principles of responsibility, transparency, and security. At the basis for any (interoperable) algorithm registry is a data schema that determines the scope of information on algorithms and describes the dataset to support common understanding.

### Building on top of existing work

Building on good practice of Amsterdam and Helsinki, DF Lab will develop a [common data schema](/standard) for algorithm registries in cities. We will produce a validated, open-source version of an algorithm registry data schema, publicly available on the GitHub platform, that is ready for use in local algorithm registries. The registry data schema includes field attributes, names, categories, types, and descriptions and signifies the minimum required fields for a common baseline.
