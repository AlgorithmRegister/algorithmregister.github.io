## About Eurocities Digital Forum Lab

Within Eurocities, the network of major cities, the Eurocities Digital Forum is a group of
cities dedicated to sharing best practices and testing new ways of working in the digital
sphere. Responding to a clear request from Eurocities members, we want to move towards achieving clear results and tangible benefits for cities and local people through the knowledge sharing activities in our network.

This ambition mirrors the development in our Digital Forum (DF) aiming to explore new working methods for cities to co-create digital solutions to tackle common challenges and to scale up existing successful solutions. The forum's steering committee has agreed to support a new methodology for innovation in cities and infrastructure to upscale digital solutions between cities. We call this the Digital Forum Lab.

Over a decade, several smart and sustainable solutions have been developed and tested in cities. The Digital Forum Lab aims to stimulate and facilitate the large upscale and uptake of those solutions, making sure people in Europe can benefit from more innovative, high-quality and cost-effective services.
