## About Eurocities DF LAB

We are testing new ways of working in Eurocities. Responding to a clear request from our members, we want to move towards achieving clear results and tangible benefits for cities and citizens through the knowledge sharing activities in our network.

This ambition mirrors the development in our digital forum (DF) aiming to explore new working methods for cities to co-create digital solutions to tackle common challenges and to scale up existing successful solutions. The DF steering committee has agreed support the development of a methodology that seeks to implement an innovation process in cities and an infrastructure to upscale digital solutions between cities. We call this the DF LAB.

Over a decade, several smart and sustainable solutions have been developed and tested in cities. DF LAB aims to stimulate and facilitate the large upscale and uptake of those solutions, making sure citizens in Europe can benefit from more innovative, high-quality and cost-effective services.
